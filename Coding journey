/New date. I have been living this day with sadness. Now is 3am. I don't sleep. At least not yet. What's my motivation to keep coding? I need to be more like a spider and keep weaving my web. Which I do by coding. I have got a headache probably from having negative thoughts. Just keep on keeping on. I got this.
Another day. Another drinking experience. I feel weak. Will I code today? Probably not. That Pascal triangle challenge is really challenging...
8/29/16. I slept ook. I was afraid that I was not going to sleep. However, I slept fine, I think. I saw a dream. And it was sorta kinda...Many people from the past intertwined within one another. And I did not have any friends in my dream, again. Just like in real life. Also, I remember my desire to be liked by others. I do not know how other people are doing it. I am not a 100 dollar bill to be liked by everyone, they say. Well, I feel my desire very strongly. And I am letting it go as much as I know how to let it go.
Plan for today:
-solve a kata. Maintain profile/upload js file. Weather app.
Tomorrow: set temperature to Celcius/Farenheit. 
2.30am. Not sleeping. Sleepy and not sleeping. trying to upload a pic to github. Not very successfully. I have set the temperature to Celcius, so kudos to me.
8/31/16 
things to do: weather app, portfolio, solve a cata, exercise. Mondrian memory game for fun. Games: armorgames, clicker heroes
