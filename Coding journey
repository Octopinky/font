New date. I have been living this day with sadness. Now is 3am. I don't sleep. At least not yet. What's my motivation to keep coding? I need to be more like a spider and keep weaving my web. Which I do by coding. I have got a headache probably from having negative thoughts. Just keep on keeping on. I got this.
